# UVP and ICP Research Notes for Visapien.com

## Research Inputs
- Salesforce SMB trends research indicates roughly three-quarters of SMBs are experimenting with or using AI, with stronger ROI among teams that treat AI as part of operations strategy and data maturity.
- Public SMB AI surveys consistently show major barriers are:
  - skills and implementation knowledge gaps,
  - integration complexity,
  - uncertainty around measurement and governance.
- The implementation gap suggests an opportunity for consultative, execution-led agencies that connect vision with operability.

## Why this matters for Visapien positioning
- Market asks for confidence and continuity, not one-off demos.
- SMB teams prefer practical playbooks and trusted implementation partners over fragmented tooling.
- Teams respond to measurable outcomes: lead-to-revenue speed, case cycle time, support response quality, repeatable reporting.

## Distilled UVP (Unique Value Proposition)
**“Visapien is the operating partner for AI-era growth: strategy, automation, and custom systems designed to remove manual complexity and produce reliable execution outcomes for SMB teams.”**

### UVP pillars
1. **Business-first framing**
   - We define AI first as a process and operating problem, not a tool-first conversation.
2. **Measured implementation**
   - Every engagement begins with outcomes, not a catalog of models.
3. **Custom build capability**
   - We connect existing stack, build missing layers, and keep governance practical.
4. **One-touch continuity**
   - We move from discovery to launch, so clients are not stranded at “pilot ended” stage.

## ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

### Primary ICP
- SMBs in B2B services, retail operations, agencies, or advisory-led teams.
- 10–150 employees.
- At least one manual bottleneck in revenue operations, customer service, or delivery operations.
- Use multiple tools across CRM/email/inventory/project trackers with no central operating layer.

### Secondary ICP
- SMBs with technical awareness but limited delivery bandwidth (they know what they need, lack execution capacity).
- Teams already moving to AI but facing low adoption from internal teams or quality concerns.

### Out-of-scope for now
- Enterprise teams with full in-house product or AI organizations.
- Greenfield companies without any defined process signals or existing customer touchpoints.

## Positioning statements you can use in copy
- “We build systems, not buzzwords.”
- “From strategy to production, not proof-of-concept-only.”
- “AI-first means fewer bottlenecks, not fancier dashboards.”

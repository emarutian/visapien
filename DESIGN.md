# Design System: Visapien

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
A high-touch, editorial technology studio tone: structured, warm, and restrained. The atmosphere is intentionally tactile and practical, emphasizing control and trust over futurism.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
- **Graphite Night** `#15161D` (copy, strong anchors, primary contrast)
- **Warm Stone** `#f3ede6` (base surface / comfortable background)
- **Bronze Accent** `#a97a3f` (highlight CTAs, action emphasis)
- **Ink Secondary** `#2f323c` (body hierarchy and muted labels)
- **Linen/Slate** `#ece7de`, `#e8dfd0` (subtle section separation and card backgrounds)

## 3. Typography Rules
- **Headlines:** `Syne` for high-contrast section headers and positioning statements.
- **Body:** `Manrope` for scannable blocks and practical copy.
- Avoid default system font pairings as the first-class stack; keep explicit token-based typography.

## 4. Component Stylings
- **Buttons:** Rounded pills with clear contrast, subtle shadows, restrained hover state.
- **Cards:** Soft corners, light stroke + muted tint, compact and dense info groups.
- **Hero media cards:** Slightly elevated elevation with structured copy plus metric list for proof.
- **Layout:** Tight vertical rhythm, 16-column-like spacing equivalent to large-screen symmetry.

## 5. Layout Principles
- Prioritize one-screen comprehension: hero, offer, process, ICP, CTA.
- Preserve generous whitespace in desktop layouts; reduce scale and stack on mobile.
- Use subtle texture rather than bright gradient for depth.
